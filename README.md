# hacklet-rs
This is a remake of [Hacklet](https://github.com/mcolyer/hacklet), written in Rust for my own use and education. Hacklet is a client for ThinkEco Modlet electric outlets, which are no longer available for sale.

Initial code is as close as possible to the original as I could get it, with the major difference being the use of libftd2xx instead of libftdi. License is the same as this almost certainly counts as a derived work.
